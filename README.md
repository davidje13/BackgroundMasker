# Wallpaper Masker

This tool adds a black bar and rounding to a provided image so that it can be set as a wallpaper to hide the "notch" on MacBook computers.

The measurements are automatically detected based on the screen size, available area, and device pixel ratio.
On computers without a "notch", this will only resize and add black rounded corners to the image.

1. Drop an image on to the viewer;
2. Drag the image to the desired position (note: zooming in on part of the image is not supported);
3. Press "Save".
